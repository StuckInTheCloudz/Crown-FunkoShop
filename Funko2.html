        <div class = "item"> <h1>About ME!<h1><h2>Hey what's up! My name is Geoffrey Won, I'm 
            currently an intern for the Code Tenderloin cohort and for
            my 2025 Code Tenderloin final project I would like to present my ATTEMPT at an ecommerce business
            selling custom FunkoPops. I know the idea's a bit farfetched but i feel like this really gave me
            alot of vital foundational HTML coding experience I may need in the future should i want to pursue UX design or
            Web Developement. As this is my first time coding an ecommerce website I hope you all enjoy what I have to showcase as my 2025 final project!
        <div class = "item"> <h1>About CROWN</h1><h2>CROWN is my first attempt at coding a website specifically designed for ecommerce.
            My mom and sister like to crochet so I thought i'd help them out by learning a bit of HTML to kick off a website for them. Anyways the goal of CROWN is to provide
            our customers with an array of Custom built Funko's tailored to what YOU want a figure of. 
            Alot of the time I find FunkoPop collectors wondering howcome there isn't a figure of this or that, so why not create
            a business that could create the ones you want FOR YOU based on your details and criterias.
